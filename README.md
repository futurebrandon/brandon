## Introduction
My name is BrandonLimbo I am in grade 10 and I like to play basketball and play videogames. My favorite games to play are NBA2k, Madden, Roblox, Fortnite, Valorant, and minecraft. My favorite game to play when im just tryna chill is roblox because of how many games there are and is the easiest to play with friends. I play fortnite when Im feeling competitive because fortnite is a very fast paced game in lategame. I play valorant because of how precise you have to be while aiming and it really helps me get better aim.
# Favorite Book or Movie
My favorite movie is Jurassic World because I dont really watch movies but I really enjoy the Jurassic world movies because of how entertaining and interesting the plot is. I like the second Jurrasic world movie. In my opinion I think this because of how creative they got and how cool the scenes were. Compared to the other ones the plot was really good and I enjoyed the fights more then I would with other movies.
# Sports or Physical Activities
A sport I have engaged in recently is basketball. A technique I learned was the between side step 3 pointer. I added it into my bag recently because my coach tells me to shoot the ball and he gives the greenlight to just shoot from anywhere. Basketball is like therapy to me and it helps me clear my mind. Basketball makes me mad as well but in general if theres a basketball and a hoop im always trying to go and hoop. The satisfaction of that ball going through the net is the best feeling a person can feel.
